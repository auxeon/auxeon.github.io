I'm a MS Computer Science student at [DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://www.digipen.edu). 
My current focus areas are AI in Video Games and Game Engine Development - This involves a lot of C++, Additionally I'm also learning Digital Signal Processing - Which is very math heavy and right now i'm working on a project to build a Reverb filter.I went to [PES University](https://www.pes.edu/) for my bachelors in Computer Science.
