<p>I gotta admit ! Iâ€™m growing evermore fond of Markdown in recent times. Ever since my Summer 2020 semester 
I use it to take notes and I even give all my CS exams in markdown and render down to pdf or html before i submit.</p>

<p>Well I think sometime last month my hosting expired and with it came the question of did I even want to renew my subscription.
And Now since I needed to get a personal website done I decided to take the plunge and setup this entire website anew using the power of static sites and jekyll ! Wonder why I messed around with a hosting solution. shout out to <a href="https://github.com/pmarsceill">Patrick Marssceil</a>. setting up this personal website has been an interesting challenge and I learnt quite a few things</p>
